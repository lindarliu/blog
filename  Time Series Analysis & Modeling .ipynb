    "## Why do we use time series analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important characteristic of time series analysis, in my opinion, is the order of the data. Order matters. If a series of temporal data is given - *1,2,3*, I will ask the question what is the relationship between 1 at $t_0$ and 3 at $t_h$, where h can be 0,1,...n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through exploring the temporal relationship among data, we turn a dimensionless problem to a dimentional problem. How? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Assume data 1,2,3 didn't happen in a time order. How do we estimate the next most likely happened number? Mean, median, mode, and probably construct probability distribution. But we can't run a regression method (require at least 1 dimension feature space).  \n",
    "* However, if the data is temporal and they are collected at $t_0$, $t_1$,... and $t_n$. We can make hypothesis about value at $t_i$ is linearly correlated with value at $t_{i-2}$. Putting that hypothesis down as math equation, it would be $$x_t =\\epsilon_t +\\alpha*x_{t-2}$$ and now the problem turns into a 1-d regression problem\n",
    "* If you agree with the logic above - the problem is a 1d problem, can you picture it being a p-dimention problem ($p<n$)? $$x_t = \\epsilon_t+\\sum^p_1{\\alpha_i*x_{t-i}}$$ This is a type of time series model called autoregressive model, **AR(p)**, and we will cover it later. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two euqations above share an important trait - **we are using data from the PAST to forecast/estimate the FUTURE.** \n",
    "\n",
    "From [this blog post](http://userwww.sfsu.edu/efc/classes/biol710/timeseries/timeseries1.htm), we see other goals we can achieve by analyzing time series\n",

    "## What kind of data is suitable for time series analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We are trying to extract meaningful statistic out of temporal data. However, if a temporal data is completely random - no systematic pattern in relation to time, then we cannot find insight. \n",
    "\n",
    "### what kind of data do we use here\n",
    "\n",
    "**The time series we are concerned will have patterns and noises.** We are going to damp the noises and recognize the patterns. The data we are concerned are all [stationary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process) (weakly stationary).\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you understand what stationary means, keep reading; otherwise, you can skip this!*\n",
    "* The assumption behind stationary process is very strong: it requires identical joint probaility distributions when shifted in time. In practice, it's hard to meet such requirement.\n",

    "    * constant mean and variance (finite) across time \n",
